Q.1.
Ans: The CSS Media Query gives you a way to apply CSS only when the browser and device environment matches a rule that you specify, for example "viewport is wider than 480 pixels". Media queries are a key part of responsive web design, as they allow you to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to detect other things about the environment your site is running on, for example whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse. In this lesson you will first learn about the syntax used in media queries, and then move on to use them in a working example showing how a simple design might be made responsive.

Q.2.
Ans: In web development, min-width and max-width are CSS properties used to define the minimum and maximum width of an element.

min-width sets the minimum width that an element can be displayed as. If the content within the element requires more space than the minimum width, the element will expand to accommodate it.

max-width sets the maximum width that an element can be displayed as. If the content within the element exceeds the maximum width, the element will shrink and create a horizontal scrollbar to allow the user to scroll through the content.

Q.3.
Ans: The properties of float and clear are important when it comes to layout design techniques. The “float” property positions an element to the left or right within its container, while the “clear” property prevents elements from wrapping around a floated element.
