Q.1.
Ans: The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top , right , bottom , and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.
To do the above, and much more, you'll use CSS's position property. This property takes in five values: static , relative , absolute , fixed , and sticky .

Q.2.
Ans: There are several types of positioning: static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky, initial and inherit. First of all, let's explain what all of these types mean. Static - this is the default value, all elements are in order as they appear in the document.

Q.3.
Ans: Z-index is the CSS property that controls the stacking order of overlapping elements on a page. An element with a higher z-index value will appear in front of an element with a lower z-index value. The property is called “z-index” because it sets the order of elements along the z-axis.
